# Water Quality Prediction – AICTE Virtual Internship Project

This project aims to analyze and predict water quality using real-world environmental datasets, as part of the AICTE-Shell-Edunet Virtual Internship Program.

## Project Objective

To develop a data-driven approach for assessing water quality by analyzing key chemical parameters. The goal is to support sustainable water management by identifying pollution patterns and predicting potential risks using machine learning.

## Dataset Overview

- **Timeframe:** 2000 – 2021  
- **Parameters Analyzed:**
  - NH4 (Ammonium)
  - BSK5 (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)
  - Suspended Solids
  - O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4, CL
  - Date of sample collection

## Key Goals

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Extract time-based features (year, month)  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Engineer features for classification or regression  
- Build predictive models for water quality rating (in future weeks)

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Platform:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome

The project will help assess water quality trends, categorize water sources by pollution level, and prepare the groundwork for predictive modeling that could aid environmental planning and monitoring.
