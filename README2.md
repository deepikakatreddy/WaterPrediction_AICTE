# Water Quality Prediction – AICTE Internship Project

This repository contains the implementation of a data-driven approach to analyze and predict water quality as part of the AICTE-Shell-Edunet Virtual Internship Program.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to assess water quality by analyzing key environmental parameters and using a machine learning model to classify pollution levels. 
This can aid in environmental monitoring and public health initiatives.

## Model Download

Due to file size limitations on GitHub, the trained model (`pollution_model.pkl`) is hosted externally on Google Drive.
